A simple Desktop application to help you listen and memorize Quran verses using multiple levels of repartitions. 

MP3s and images are downloaded as needed only once and reused.

To use just download all this repo to any folder and launch run.cmd

currently works for windows but will be adjusted for linux later inshallah.
